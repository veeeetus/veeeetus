Hello!

A few months ago, I graduated from a technical school with an IT Technician profile. Right now, I'm planning to further deepen my knowledge about computer science in college, starting in October 2023. I'll be pursuing a specialization in Application and Cloud Systems Engineering at DSW Wroc≈Çaw.

I'm constantly working on improving and learning new things every day. Currently, I'm taking courses on various topics, such as Linux basics and project management frameworks. Additionally, I'm delving into cloud computing fundamentals. Apart from that, I'm also enhancing my Python skills through daily practice on Codewars.
