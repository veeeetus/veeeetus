Hello!
My name is David, I'm currently studying Computer Science at University of Lower Silesia DSW. Lately I got fascinated by cloud world! So I'm learning the ropes of cloud computing and AWS as well as some python and linux. I do love Japan and games, I'm also huge fan of D&D. I'm up for any fun projects so if you need a python dev then hit me up!
